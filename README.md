Hey there!   
This is my personal roadmap where I track my progress learning system administration and building my home lab.

## Folders

- Core networking concepts (SSH, Firewall, DNS, Port Forwarding)  
- GitHub for project management and public progress tracking  
- Backup strategies to secure data   
- Setting up my own DNS server
