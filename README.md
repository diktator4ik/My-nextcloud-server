# My IT Journey Roadmap ðŸš€

Hey there!   
This is my personal roadmap where I track my progress learning system administration and building my home lab.

## Folders
- Scripts - for different batch scripts
- Configs - example of my working configurations
- Markdown - Text way of expressing my milestones
- data - This is folder for nextcloud data
- k8s - Well... kubernetes yamls etc
  
## What is this project about? 

This repo is my digital playground for storing notes, configs, ideas, and steps I take on the path to becoming a Junior System Administrator or maybe even Junior DevOps =D. Here I gather everything I learn â€” from Linux basics to network setup and home server projects.

## Technologies & Tools I'm Using 

- VMware virtual machines running Ubuntu Linux
- Kubernetes, minikube  
- Nginx web server and reverse proxy
- Prometheus, graphana, loki, etc
- Nextcloud for cloud storage and automation  
- Bash scripts for task automation  
- Core networking concepts (SSH, Firewall, DNS, Port Forwarding)  
- GitHub for project management and public progress tracking  
- Backup strategies to secure data   
- Setting up my own DNS server   
- VPN configuration for secure remote access(thinking about wireguard)   
- Syncing Nextcloud data with my phone   
- Telegram bot integration for notifications and control   

## My achievments 

- [x] Install Ubuntu on VMware
